				I guess I'm crazy.  I'm going with a computer game.  By myself.
				
				<br><br>Wait wait.  Even better, this is an HTML5/Javascript game using the Craftyjs library.
				
				<br><br>I have never done any of these things before, except the Javascript.
				
				<br><br>I really wanted the experience of fiddling with HTML5.  The only dedicated game engine
				I've used before is Unity, and I don't have the time to get that to work -- Unity is really
				really bad for drawing lines, as I've discovered.  I've used Processing before, but Java isn't
				the best way to deliver a game (and I use too much Java to export to Processing.js) 
				
				<br><br>So, since I didn't want to use Flash (as it's not supported by mobile devices), here's HTML5.
				<br><br>
			</p>
			
			<h1 class="testUI">Theme</h1>
			<p class="testUI">
				This game is eventually going to be based on a class I took last semester called Operating Systems.  It was a gruelling class
				that's left me with a bitter feeling -- I learned so much, yet I feel it was taught horribly.
				
				<br><br>Not only that, it's seen as a terrifying class by everyone.  I want to see if making a game about it, turning
				the experience into fuel for something else I enjoy, can help me resolve my feelings (plus, make the class seem less
				intimidating for others).  
				
				<br><br>Because of this theme, some notation I'll use, like powerups being called things like 'Vanish' and 'Exec',
				are OS-specific -- I don't expect you to understand what they mean just from playing the prototype.
				<br><br>
			</p>	
			
			<h1 class="testUI">How to Play</h1>	
			<p class="testUI">
				<br><br>You're a white ball on a graph.  You can move with the left and right arrow keys to slide along whatever edge
				you're perched on.  At junctures and dead ends, you'll need to choose
				which direction to travel in by pressing the key that pops up on a circular HUD.
				
				<br><br>Some junctures have special events sitting on them, called things like 'Vanish' and 'Exec'.  When
				these words pop up on your HUD, you can activate them with the space bar.

				<br><br>Vanish destroys the graph you're on (in game, this will be the equivalent of beating the level).
				Exec teleports the player back to the graph's beginning.  Another planned feature, Fork, hasn't been implemented yet,
				as I'm still deciding on whether to let that mean the graph is duplicated, or if the graph spawns another
				player you can control.Some junctures have special events sitting on them, called things like 'Vanish' and 'Exec'.  When
				these words pop up on your HUD, you can activate them with the space bar.
				
				<br><br>You have multiple graphs to complete.  You can swap between them at any time by pressing 's'.
								
				<br><br>The objective is to try to navigate the entire graph.  There's no win/lose condition right now,
				as I've spent so much time just trying to get the framework of the game ready (don't get me started on 
				the UI), but it's enough to see the big gameplay mechanics that'll be in there.
				
				<br><br>Needless to say it still needs a lot of work, but it's been an enriching experience.
